# Dockerized Django Project

This repository contains a Dockerfile and instructions for running a Django project in a Docker container. Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a single container, making it easy to deploy and manage.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Your Django project code
- A `requirements.txt` file listing your project's Python dependencies.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or create a Dockerfile based on the provided example.

2. Place your Django project code in the same directory as the Dockerfile.

3. Create a `requirements.txt` file in the same directory and list all your project's Python dependencies in it.

4. Build the Docker image using the following command:

    ```bash
    docker build -t my-django-app .
    ```

    Replace `my-django-app` with the desired name for your Docker image.

5. Run a Docker container from the image using the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 my-django-app
    ```

    This command maps port 8000 in the container to port 8000 on your host machine. Adjust the port mapping as needed.

6. Access your Django application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Customization

You can customize this Dockerfile to fit your project's specific requirements. For example, if your project uses a different version of Python or has additional configuration, you can modify the Dockerfile accordingly.
